## Overview of Algorithms

### Bell's Inequality
Bell's Inequality is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics that challenges classical intuitions about correlations. It highlights the non-classical nature of quantum mechanics. This inequality serves as a litmus test to distinguish between classical and quantum systems. By running a version of Bell's inequality experiment, we can observe the violation of this inequality, demonstrating the quantum behavior of a system.

### Bernstein–Vazirani Algorithm
The Bernstein–Vazirani Algorithm is a quantum algorithm designed to efficiently find a hidden binary string. Classically, discovering such a hidden string would require multiple queries to a black-box function. However, this algorithm can reveal the entire hidden string with just one query. It's an extension of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, where the function is guaranteed to be either constant or balanced.

### CHSH Inequality
The Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Inequality is a generalization of Bell's Inequality. It provides a framework for testing quantum entanglement and violations of local realism. The inequality compares the correlations between measurements on entangled particles with classical correlations. Violations of the CHSH Inequality indicate non-classical, quantum behavior.

### Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm
The Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm is one of the pioneering quantum algorithms. It aims to determine specific properties of functions with significantly greater efficiency than classical counterparts. Specifically, it distinguishes between constant and balanced functions. While the classical approach requires multiple function queries, this quantum algorithm provides the answer in a single query.

### Grover's Search
Grover's Search is a quantum algorithm that offers a significant speedup for searching an unsorted database or solving black-box computational problems. Classical search algorithms have a complexity of O(N), while Grover's algorithm reduces this to O(√N), making it exponentially faster in finding the desired item or solution.

### Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)
The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) demonstrates the potential of quantum computers to address real-world combinatorial optimization problems. It combines classical and quantum processing to find approximate solutions to optimization problems more efficiently than classical algorithms.

### Quantum Circuit Born Machine (QCBM)
The Quantum Circuit Born Machine (QCBM) is a quantum algorithm that introduces quantum circuits as generative models. It has applications in quantum machine learning and explores the use of quantum circuits for generating data distributions. QCBM opens up new possibilities for quantum-enhanced machine learning.

### Quantum Fourier Transform
The Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) is a quantum algorithm that enables faster computation of the Fourier transform, a fundamental mathematical operation. QFT has applications in many quantum algorithms, particularly in quantum cryptography and solving certain mathematical problems.

### Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE)
Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is a critical quantum algorithm used to determine the eigenvalues of unitary operators. It plays a pivotal role in fields like cryptography and advanced mathematics. QPE is essential for various quantum algorithms, making it a fundamental building block of quantum computing.

### Quantum Walk
A Quantum Walk is a quantum analogue of the classical random walk. It provides insights into quantum dynamics and offers solutions to specific problems more efficiently than classical methods. Quantum walks have applications in simulating physical systems and developing quantum algorithms.

### Shor's Algorithm
Shor's Algorithm is a groundbreaking quantum algorithm known for its ability to factor large numbers efficiently. Factoring large numbers is a classically hard problem and forms the basis of modern encryption methods. Shor's algorithm has significant implications for cryptography and poses a potential threat to classical encryption systems.

### Simon's Algorithm
Simon's Algorithm is designed to identify a certain hidden property of functions with a speedup over classical solutions. It's a prime example of how quantum algorithms can outperform classical ones in specific tasks. Simon's Algorithm has applications in various areas, including cryptography and database search.
